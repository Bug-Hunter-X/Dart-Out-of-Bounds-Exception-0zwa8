# Dart Out-of-Bounds Exception Example

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: the out-of-bounds exception that occurs when accessing an array element using an index that is greater than or equal to the array's length.  The `bug.dart` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.dart` shows how to fix it by implementing input validation to prevent the exception.

## Running the Code

To run the code, clone this repository and then run the Dart program from your terminal using the command `dart bug.dart` (and similarly for `bugSolution.dart`).
